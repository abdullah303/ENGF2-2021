bug 1: The turtles do not work if you land on them. You just lose a live if you land on them. You should be able to stand on them.
       I fixed this by changing a typo on line 374 of fr_model.py, where it said "on_long" instead of "on_log".

bug 2: If you die, you stand still and all your lives are drained until game over. When you die, you should lose one life and be
       spawn. I fixed this by adding the line "self.frog.reset_postition()" to the "new_life" function.

bug 3: The left nost pit doesnt work. If you try land on it, you will die. You should be able to land on it so that you can
       finish the level. I fixed this by changing the starting location of the pit creating function to -100 instead of 100.

bug 4: Time doesn't decrease. It should decrease as you play. I'm not sure how to fix this.

bug 5: I'm not sure if this is a bug, but I think the turtles need some more tolerance if a frog lands on the left hand side.
       Sometime's it looks like you should've landed, but it counts as you dying. I added an arbritary tolerance of 10 pixels
       to landing on the left side of the log on the "contain" function, and the game feels smoother.
